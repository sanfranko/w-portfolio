Me and my friend made Hydra, a sneaky computer virus that can move between computers on the same network! We got permission from our boss to try it out at our school, and it worked really well! We called it Hydra because it spreads like a multi-headed monster, and it definitely lived up to its name! Our goal was to get into the Microtik admin page, and we did it perfectly! We ran the virus from one computer and sent it to all the others. We were excited to find out that we infected 90% of them! Only 10% didn't have the right kind of internet connection. When the head of the school saw what we did, he offered to sell us his similar program as long as we kept it secret. We agreed to put our project in our portfolio without sharing how we did it.
