Im was born in a small town. When I was in 2nd grade, I started learning to play the piano. In 3rd grade, my parents got me a computer, and ever since then, I've been hooked. When I got 8th grade, I began learning coding on Python. I'm currently studying cybersecurity. In my spare time im wathing movies, playing Valorant and sometimes working with my friend for our project.
